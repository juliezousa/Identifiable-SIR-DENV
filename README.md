# An Identifiable Model of Dengue Transmission with Time-Dependent Transmission Rate and Susceptible Influx

This repository contains the source code used to reproduce results from the paper:

> **"An Identifiable Model of Dengue Transmission with Time-Dependent Transmission Rate and Susceptible Influx"**

The code implements:
- Deterministic dengue transmission model with time-dependent transmission rate.
- Parameter estimation via **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** fits to incidence data.
- **Sensitivity analysis** of key epidemiological and model parameters.
